# gr-tempest
An implementation of TEMPEST en GNU Radio. 

*This is very early work*, I'm basically uploading this to organize myself. 

At this points, I've basically re-implemented Martin Marinov's TempestSDR in GNU Radio (see https://github.com/martinmarinov/TempestSDR). 

Requirements: GNU Radio 3.7. 

I've tried using as many blocks as possible from GNU Radio's core, but I've had to implement a couple for vertical and horizontal synchronization. 

See the examples folder for a working example. Recording may be obtained from https://iie.fing.edu.uy/investigacion/grupos/artes/es/proyectos/espionaje-por-emisiones-electromagneticas/ (in spanish).
